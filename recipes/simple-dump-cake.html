    <h1>Simple Dump Cake</h1>
    <p>This is a very simple recipe with a minimum of 4 basic ingredients. You can add some more if you want, but it's a hit at potlucks even with just the 4.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Can of crushed pineapple, around 15-16~ oz.</li>
        <li>1 Can of cherry pie filling, around 15oz, same size ish of the pineapple</li>
        <li>Salted Butter, I usually do one stick. I like Kerrygold but you can pick anything.</li>
        <li>Yellow Cake, I typically get one box of Duncan Hines or Krustyaz, or you can do a gluten free box if needed. I believe pillsbury makes one.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You'll want a 9x13 pan. A 9x9 can be fine but it will be thicker of course. If you don't have one at home they are really cheap for disposable ones</li>
        <li>If no one has a nut allergy, pecans are a popular 5th ingredient addition. I usually will top half the cake for people that do prefer</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the fruits in, the order doesn't really matter.</li>
        <li>Mix them up to where they are evenly distributed</li>
        <li>Spread out the yellow cake on top, try to make it as flat as possible</li>
        <li>Melt the butter and then pour it on top, try to spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 20 minutes at 425 degrees, keep an eye on it. Pull it out when it's golden.</li>
        <li>Take it out and keep it warm or put it in the fridge to cool overnight.</li>
        <li>Serve by itself or warm it up and top it with vanilla icecream for an extra treat!</li>
    </ol>
